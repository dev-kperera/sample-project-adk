When pre-built tools don't fully meet specific requirements, you can create your own tools. This allows for tailored functionality, such as connecting to proprietary databases or implementing unique algorithms.

# How to test
1. Run `adk web`
2. Select the agent
3. Say `Hello`
4. Enter your journal entry
5. Notice that your agent shows buttons for your custom tool's request and the response. You can click on each to see more information about each of these events.
